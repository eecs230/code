# This file configures your Python environment by specifying the versions
# of libraries that we depend on, as well as the version of Python itself.
# Versions specified in this file may be ambigous, but the exact versions
# used the first time you run your program are cached in Pipfile.lock. You
# should never edit Pipfile.lock directly.
